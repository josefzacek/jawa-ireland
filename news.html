    <p>19.8.2012 - <span class="red">Ride a scooter on your car licence! </span> - Did you know that the majority of Irish car licences category B come with full category M entitlement. This gives you automatic entitlement to use up to 50cc mopeds.

And what better way to beat traffic and save money! By leaving the car at home and switching over to one of these traffic busters you can save up to €2000 per annum.

50cc scooters can give fuel efficiency figures in the region of 200 miles per gallon!</p>
    <p> With prices starting from as little as €950 for a new model, you would spend more on public transport annually.
      
      These bikes come with  2 years parts and labour warranty, 1st service free, and we can also do package deals on any clothing that you need to make the whole experience safe and comfortable. So what are you waiting for?</p>
    <p> Drop in to Jawa Ireland today and say bye bye to traffic and large petrol consumption.</p>

    <p>28.7.2012 - <span class="red">Kawasaki first at Festival of Speed </span> - The event  running from August 24 to August 27  is a mecca for petrol heads of all descriptions and is a logical place to see the latest range of Kawasaki machinery according to Aimee Osmond of Kawasaki Motors UK.</p>
    <p>The Festival of Speed is an internationally recognised event and it has always promoted two wheels as well as four. We are delighted to attend this year and the Kawasaki stand will show a cross-section of our latest models, as well as adding a few welcome surprises. In addition we also hope that Shane Byrne and other Kawasaki British Superbike riders will tackle the famous twisting Festival of Speed course on their Ninja ZX-10R machines.</p>
    <p> Located in the corporate exhibition area across the track from Goodwood House itself, the variety of motorcycles on display covers the majority of biking bases according to Osmond. <br />
